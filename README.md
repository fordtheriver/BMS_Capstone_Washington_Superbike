# BMS_Capstone_Washington_Superbike
This repository includes firmware, PCB design files and documentation to build the BMS for Washington Superbike. This BMS uses the TI MSP430F5529 microcontroller to interface with the LTC6811-1 Battery Stack Monitor. 

This code is written in C in Code Composer Studio. 

Current firmware is full of bugs and should be debugged by the end of June.

EAGLE PCB design files are included in the EAGLE folder
